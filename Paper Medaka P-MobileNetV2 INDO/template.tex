% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{\textit{Oryzias Celebensis} and \textit{Oryzias Javanicus} are two species of endemic fish that play a crucial role in the aquatic ecosystem in Indonesia, especially in Java and Sulawesi regions. But unfortunately, both species are threatened with extinction and have been officially declared by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). To address this problem, Artificial Intelligence innovation was built with a Deep Learning approach to conduct classification and identification of the fish species quickly and efficiently. In this study, we developed the MobileNetV2 architecture model using the transfer learning approach and dataset padding in this system to classify \textit{O. Celebensis} and \textit{O. Javanicus}. The P-MobileNetV2 model has better performance evaluation results than other models, where sensitivity = $98.46\%$, Precision = $98.46\%$, F1 Score = $98.46\%$ and Accuracy = $98.7\%$. This advancement enables rapid, accurate conservation efforts for these critically endangered fish}
