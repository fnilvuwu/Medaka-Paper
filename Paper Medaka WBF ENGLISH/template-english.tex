\abstract{Reliable detection of Medaka (Oryzias) fish is essential for ecological monitoring and conservation, particularly for tracking population trends of endangered species. This study evaluates the performance of a state-of-the-art deep learning model (YOLOv8) and an ensemble approach using Weighted Box Fusion (WBF) on a manually annotated dataset of Medaka images collected from online sources. Models were trained and validated using 5-fold cross-validation, and performance was assessed using COCO metrics, including mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and bounding box regression error. The YOLOv8-WBF ensemble achieved a mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.578, representing an 8\% improvement over the best single model. It also enhanced bounding box localization and classification reliability, particularly for small and visually challenging fish instances. These accuracy gains came at the expense of computational efficiency, with inference requiring approximately five times more operations than a single YOLOv8 model. While less suited for real-time deployment, the ensemble approach offers more reliable detection for offline ecological workflows, where accuracy is prioritized over speed. By reducing missed detections of rare or occluded fish, this work contributes to more robust biodiversity monitoring and provides a baseline for developing optimized ensemble and lightweight detection models in aquatic conservation.}
