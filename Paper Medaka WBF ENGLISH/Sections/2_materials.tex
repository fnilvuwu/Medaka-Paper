\subsection{Data Sources}
The dataset used in this study consisted of both primary and secondary images of Medaka fish. Primary data were obtained by directly photographing \textit{Oryzias javanicus} and \textit{Oryzias celebensis} in an aquarium using a digital camera. Secondary data were collected from publicly available sources, including research websites, aquatic forums, and open-access databases. The final dataset contained 792 images after curation, covering a variety of lighting conditions and viewing angles to enhance robustness and generalization. All annotated datasets and code used in this study will be made publicly available in an online repository upon publication. Since only non-invasive aquarium photography was conducted, no ethical approval was required for animal experimentation. 

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
All images were standardized in orientation, resolution, and color balance. Image restoration (contrast enhancement, artifact removal), data augmentation (flipping, rotations of $90^{\circ}$, $180^{\circ}$, and $270^{\circ}$), and normalization were applied. Annotation was performed using the Roboflow platform, with bounding boxes and class labels stored in YOLO format. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets with proportions of 80\%, 10\%, and 10\%, respectively.

\subsection{Model Training}
We fine-tuned the YOLOv8 architecture on the annotated dataset. To evaluate robustness, 5-fold cross-validation was employed. For ensemble learning, multiple YOLOv8 models with different weight initializations were combined using Weighted Box Fusion (WBF). Training and evaluation were performed on an NVIDIA GPU with default YOLOv8 hyperparameters unless otherwise specified. The implementation was carried out in Python using the Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
Model performance was assessed using COCO metrics, including mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95), precision, recall, and bounding box regression error (RMSE). Confusion matrices and loss curves were also analyzed to assess classification performance and model convergence.

\subsection{Use of Generative AI}
Generative artificial intelligence (ChatGPT, OpenAI) was used solely to improve the clarity and language of the manuscript. No AI tools were used to generate data, perform analyses, or influence interpretation of results.
